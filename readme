Fotag is an application that users can load images, and display these images 
in a dynamic layout that responds to device orientation. The main interface 
has a rating bar on the top left corner, and the first button from left is for
 clearing all images, the second button is for loading images, and the third 
 button is for clearing stars from rating bar. For every image, when we click 
 it, there is a pop up window which shows the full size of this image. In 
 addition, users can rate every image and clear their rate.
